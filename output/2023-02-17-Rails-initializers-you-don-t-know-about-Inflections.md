* **Web site excerpt:** Fun Rails Esoterica. One of the features that new Rails people are amused and surprised by: "Rails come with a lot of initializers that we are not quite familiar with. One of them is the inflections initializer. In this post, we will look at what inflections.rb is and how we can use them."
